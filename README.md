# AI-Driven-Crop-Disease-Prediction-and-Management-System
Our project, an AI-Driven Crop Disease Prediction and Management System, aims to help farmers detect crop diseases early and manage risks efficiently. By leveraging AI and ML, our system will analyze crop images, environmental conditions, and soil data to predict disease outbreaks. It will provide actionable insights, disease identification, and treatment recommendations through a mobile and web-based platform.
Additionally, the system will include AI-powered dynamic pricing and demand forecasting to help farmers get the best prices for their produce, weather and soil analysis predictions to optimize farming decisions and an AI-powered chatbot to assist users in navigating the app and accessing critical information.
